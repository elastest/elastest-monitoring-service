ElasTest Monitoring Service.

# What is ElasTest

This repository is part of [ElasTest], which is an open source elastic platform
aimed to simplify end-to-end testing. ElasTest platform is based on three
principles: i) Test orchestration: Combining intelligently testing units for
creating a more complete test suite following the “divide and conquer” principle.
ii) Instrumentation and monitoring: Customizing the SuT (Subject under Test)
infrastructure so that it reproduces real-world operational behavior and allowing
to gather relevant information during testing. iii) Test recommendation: Using machine
learning and cognitive computing for recommending testing actions and providing
testers with friendly interactive facilities for decision taking.
